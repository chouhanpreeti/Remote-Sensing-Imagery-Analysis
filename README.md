Remote Sensing Imagery Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks for Landscape Classification and Insights

## Objective

<p align="justify">
Landscape classification is used to inform public policy and guide sustainable development by ”identifying the removal or disturbance of productive land, urban encroachment, and depletion of forests”. Due to the large volume of images produced by remote sensing technology there is a need to automate the analysis of satelite imagery to save time and reduce costs. However, there are challenges when working with satellite images. It is necessary to consider spatial and spectral resolution along with general geometric characteristics of the imagery. Furthermore, natural phenomena such as clouds can obscure the subject matter. In this project, our goal is to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify land use through land classification to better inform the public policy that shapes sustainable development. As a result, these models can be used in real-time to monitor the effectiveness of the sustainable development policy by allowing a network of remote sensing tools to automatically classify, analyse, and report on land use. As a novelty, our aim is to leverage the EuroSATallBands data available in the EuroSat dataset to investigate the impact that different color channels and spectral bands have on the results as opposed to traditional RGB images.
